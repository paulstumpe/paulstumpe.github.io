// Operators
// Operators are used to act on our data. They can manipulate it, turning 2 
// numbers into a boolean value by comparing them for instance.
// Assignment operators
// Assignment operators are used to change the contents of a variable, from 
// taking it past undefined, to adding on and incrementing
var i = 1+2;
i=+3;
// Arithmetic operators
// Arithmetic Operators largely carry out mathematical maniuplations on our data. 
// But they can also act on some non numerical datatypes,
// for instence appending strings together.
1+2-3*4/6;
// Comparison operators
//Comparison operators always evaluate for truthiness, by comparing data.
1<4;
2===5;
// Logical operators
//logical operators allow us to flip the statements testing, like with the bang 
// operator. or can be used to test for the truth of multiple
//statements at once
1<2 && 3<4;
// Unary operators (!, typeOf, -)
// unary operators are a bit special. They only need one argument or piece of data to work with.
// Ternary operator (a ? b : c)
//Ternary is the other side of this. It can take three statements. Could be used 
// similiar to an if statement, in shorter writing.
