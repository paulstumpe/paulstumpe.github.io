// String manipulation
/* String manipulations can be done via methods or operators. A string 
* manipulation is simly code
* which changes the value of a string, by removing, adding and/or rearranging its characters.
*/

//With operators
// the addition operator can be used to cacotanate two strings, appending the 
// second string to the first.
console.log("hello" + "my friend.");
// The addition operator will not add any characters, so any apces needed between 
// the two strings
// one intends on cacotanating needs to be present beforehand.

// With string methods
console.log("h".toUpperCase());
// This method would return the uppercase letter H. There are many methods for manipulating strings
// such as toUpperCase, toLowerCase, and split.
console.log("hello world".split(" "))
// this would split hello world into an array of strings at the space " " character.
